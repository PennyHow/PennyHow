### My name is Dr. Penelope How (she/her üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà) 

I am a **data scientist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS)**, focusing on monitoring the Greenland Ice Sheet and creating workflows for big data processing. 

I have a PhD in glaciology from the University of Edinburgh and the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) in 2018, where I examined the dynamics of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard, primarily using time-lapse cameras and photogrammetry techniques. Within this time, I learnt to code in Python and developed an object-oriented toolbox called [PyTrx](https://github.com/PennyHow/PyTrx) for deriving measurements from terrestrial glacial imagery. I continued to develop my expertise in programming during my post-doctoral researcher position at the University of York, and as a remote sensing specialist at Asiaq Greenland Survey in Nuuk, Greenland.

**Coding interests**: *big data processing, terrestrial time-lapse photogrammetry, remote sensing and image handling, web scraping*
